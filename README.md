## game cheat engine
    first level:
    big mountain (no jumping)

    8-10 levels
	
##
	time you need to find glitches in the map to make sure your time is under a certain amount

horror: 
	
## to difficult for 3 days

write your own code to fix the game


## other people:
	
	2D platformer backing the game, Glitch platforms

	AI: backing the 4th wall, 


## email: contact the dev 

    this will have elements from the password game.

    start:
    crash of game, contact the devs via an email client  

    the game does not want to be fixed for each complaint it breaks down  

    for each successful email the game becomes playable again  

    1. make an account  

    while managing the email you need to stop the game from trying to infect the email client.  

    2. write an email  
    3. wait for the response  
    4. response can be successful or bad  

    

    Problem:
    the ui is difficult to implement

    we can go with a retro style
